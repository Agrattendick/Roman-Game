# Pirate Game
A simple little combat game pitting Sailors against Pirates. Nothing too complex, just a fun little example of what I've learned so far.

Previously Roman Legionaries fought against Barbarians, but with a change in code the theme was reworked as well. In the Roman v. Barbarian version there was only one move, an attack, and it either hit and did damange or missed and did not. Now there are different kinds of attacks to choose from with their own modifers. These attacks not only damage health but can affect other base stats as well. Attacks now also use a new stat called Energy; it's depleated by attacks, but some regenerates every round.

#### Current Goals:
* Code in the new rules for the new characters.
* Code in an AI, as there are now more action options than just Attack.


#### Future Goals:
* Add some visuals to the game.
	* Bar Charts for current health and energy for each character.
* Add way for players to choose their stats and weapons.
* Add back in the Roman Legionary and Barbarian updated for the new rules.
